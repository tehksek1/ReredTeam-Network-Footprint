# ReredTeam-Network-Footprint
Beginner red team lab projects: Nmap scans, DHCP/DNS spoofing, Scapy scripting, Wireshark traffic analysis, and firewall evasion.
# 🛡️ Red Team Phase 1 Labs

Welcome to my beginner red team portfolio!  
This repository contains hands-on labs and scripts focusing on network-level offensive security, including scanning, protocol spoofing, scripting, and evasion techniques.
